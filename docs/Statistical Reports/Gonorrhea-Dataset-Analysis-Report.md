## Introduction
This report presents a detailed analysis of the Gonorrhea dataset, which contains information about reported cases of Gonorrhea in the United States from 2000 to 2014. The data source for this analysis is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

## Dataset Description
The Gonorrhea dataset includes the following columns:
- `Year`: The year in which the cases were reported.
- `State`: The state in which the cases were reported.
- `Cases`: The number of reported cases of Gonorrhea.
- `Male 15-44`: The number of reported cases among males aged 15-44.
- `Incidence Rate Lower CI`: The lower confidence interval for the incidence rate.
- `Incidence Rate Upper CI`: The upper confidence interval for the incidence rate.

## Data Analysis
We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, including:
- Descriptive statistics for each column.
- Data visualization, including box plots, bar charts, and line charts.
- Trends and patterns over the years.

## Findings
Here are some key findings from the analysis:
- The number of reported cases of Gonorrhea varied over the years, with fluctuations.
- Incidence rates showed variations across states.
- Gender-based analysis revealed insights into male cases.
- Confidence intervals provided insights into the uncertainty of incidence rates.

## Data Visualizations

### Box Plots
Box plots were used to visualize the distribution of data across the years for each column.

### Bar Charts
Bar charts were created to show the sum of cases for each year.

## Conclusion
The analysis of the Gonorrhea dataset provided insights into the reported cases and incidence rates over the years. Understanding the trends and patterns in this dataset can aid in public health efforts and decision-making.

## Recommendations
Further analysis and research are recommended to understand the underlying factors contributing to Gonorrhea cases and to inform prevention strategies.
